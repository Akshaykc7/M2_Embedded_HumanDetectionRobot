# METHODOLOGY
- The rescue operation by the workers in the earthquake affected areas is very difficult because it involves large area and hence it is time consuming.
- Vehicle that moves in the earthquake  affected area.
- As a whole the robot’s movement is controlled with the PC or phone. 
- Gas sensor senses the toxic gas present near the victim and it will be compared with the already set reference temperature. 
- Gas detection and fire detection
- Message send to the respective person and department.
