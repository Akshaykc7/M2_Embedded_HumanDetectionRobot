**INTRODUCTION:**
- Rescue robotics is clearly a challenging ﬁeld with many open issues. 
- This section discusses the challenges by subsystem (mobility, communications, control, sensors, power), then the general human–robot interaction (HRI) challenges, and ﬁnally the remaining problems in evaluation. 
- In addition to these speciﬁc are as discussed below, there are three cross-cutting challenges that should be mentioned: 
- How to reduce mission times; how to localize, map, and integrate data from the robots into the larger geographic information systems used by strategic decision makers; and how to improve the overall reliability of rescue robots. 


**OBJECTIVE:**
- The main objective of the project is to detect humans in earthquake condition.
- To provide instance back support or force if necessary. 
- To detect position of person during extreme condition.
- To detect any metal items and toxic gas in the particular area

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:**
- Efficiency.
- Decision making abilities.
- Night vision technology.
- User friendly interface.
- Effective communication system.




**4W’s and 1H’s:**

**Who**

- For army, rescue team can use this robot

**What**

- The PIR sensor can detect human within 10 meters.
- With the help of IR sensor presence of human will be know

**When**

- This project is going to be deployed on 02/12/2021

**Where**

- This robot is used in war and natural calamities .

**How**

-This program can be executed in a system which has Linux/Mac or Windows operating system.

**Swot Analysis:**

**Strength**

- With the detection or point of contact with the human being the message is sent instant to the mobile application.
- This robot can be used in bad path condition also.

**Weakness**

- PIR sensor fails to sense humans out of its range: PIR sensor detects a human
being moving around within approximately 10m from the sensor.
- The main drawback of the system is that it is more prone to get struck under
the deformed structures and also it is not cost efficiency.

**Opportunities**

- This receiver processes the received signal and provides such information which is displayed on a display unit.

**Threats**

- With the increase in temperature there might be some wrong information due to the use of PIR Sensor.

**Components:**

- Buzzer
- LCD panel
- PIR Sensor
- IR Sensor
- Buffer
- DC Motor – Gear Motor
- ATMEGA 328
